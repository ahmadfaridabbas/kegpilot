/// Securely answers `sudo`'s askpass prompt for the one Homebrew command that needs an admin
/// password (a cask whose payload runs `/usr/sbin/installer -pkg`, e.g. `zoom`). Homebrew only
/// passes `sudo -A` when `SUDO_ASKPASS` is set; sudo then runs that helper and reads the password
/// from the helper's **standard output** (see `man sudo`).
///
/// SECURITY MODEL (the whole point of this type):
/// - The password is NEVER placed in `argv`, in an environment variable, or in a regular file.
/// - The helper script we write contains only two FIFO paths — not the password.
/// - When sudo runs the helper, the helper (1) writes one byte to a *request* FIFO to tell KegPilot
///   "sudo is asking now", then (2) `cat`s a *response* FIFO to its stdout. KegPilot prompts the user
///   with a native secure field, then writes the password to the response FIFO exactly once. The
///   password transits only a 0600 FIFO (an in-kernel pipe buffer; no bytes hit the filesystem) and
///   otherwise lives only in a Swift `String` held for the duration of the install.
/// - The temp directory is `0700`, both FIFOs are `0600`, owned by the current user. Everything is
///   removed when the command finishes (or on stop/clear/deinit).
///
/// Each sudo authentication re-invokes the helper (sudo may retry a few times), so the request
/// watcher loops: every time the helper signals, KegPilot is asked again. The caller decides whether
/// to re-prompt or reuse the password it already has.
