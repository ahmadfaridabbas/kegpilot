/// A recoverable failure that KegPilot can offer to fix with one click. Two flavours are covered:
///
/// 1. `.resumableDownload` — Homebrew's "resumable download" dead-end: when a partial file is left
///    in brew's download cache and the file's HTTP server does not honour byte-range (resume)
///    requests, curl aborts with `curl: (56) … Cannot resume`. brew retries once, hits the same
///    wall, and gives up. The fix is to clear the stale cached download so the next fetch starts
///    fresh (`brew cleanup <token>`, then re-run the command).
///
/// 2. `.staleAppArtifact` — a cask upgrade fails with `It seems there is already an App at '…'`
///    because a leftover `.app` from the previous version blocks the install. The fix is to re-run
///    the same command with `--force`, which tells brew to overwrite the existing artifact.
